Create your custom 404 error page the easy way! No coding. Works with most Themes.

== Description ==

<strong>With 90,000+ active installations the [404page](https://petersplugins.com/free-wordpress-plugins/404page/) plugin is the most used plugin to create a customized 404 error page in WordPress.</strong>

Bringing visitors to your website takes time and effort. Every visitor is important. The default 404 error page of most themes do not provide any information on what to find on your site. A first tme visitor, who does not know you, is left in a dead end and leaves your website. Set up a helpful custom 404 error page to keep him on your site.

This handy plugin allows you to easily create your own 404 error page without any effort and it works with almost every theme.

== Usage ==

Create your custom 404 error page just like any other page using the WordPress Page Editor. Then go to 'Appearance' -> '404 Error Page' and select the created page as your custom 404 error page. That's it!

== Why use this plugin? ==

Different from other similar plugins the 404page plugin **does not create redirects**. That’s **quite important** because a correct code 404 is delivered which tells search engines that the page does not exist and has to be removed from the index.

Different from other similar plugins the 404page plugin **does not create additional server requests**. 

== Requirements ==

The only requirement for this plugin is that you change the Permalink Structure in ‘Settings’ -> ‘Permalinks’ to anything else but ‘Plain’. This also activates the WordPress 404 error handling.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it work with the theme I'm using? =

This plugin is designed to work with as many themes as possible. It uses the WordPress Template System to detect and handle 404 errors. If your theme makes use of this Template System this plugin will work properly. If it does not the plugin offers a so called Compatibility Mode, which uses its completely own method to detect and handle 404 errors. If this plugin does not work properly, try to activate Compatibility Mode.

= Are 404 errors redirected? =

No, there is no redirection! The chosen page is delivered as a 'real' 404 error page. This results in a HTTP 404 code and not in 301 or 302, which is important for Search Engines to tell them, that the page does not exist and should be deleted from the index.

= Is it possible to add custom CSS to the 404 page? =

The 404page plugin adds a CSS class `error404` to the `<body>` tag which can be used for extra styling.

= Where can I get help? =
